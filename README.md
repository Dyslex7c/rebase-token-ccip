A rebase token is one whose total supply is automatically adjusted based on an interest rate. Users are incentivized to deposit ETH into a vault contract and gain rewards in return. This interest rate gradually decreases over time to incentivize early adoption.

Rebasing doesn't affect the overall value of each user's holdings proportionally, it changes the number of tokens in wallets to maintain a target value.

Call script `bridgeTozkSync.sh` to send over RBT from Ethereum to zkSync testnet.
